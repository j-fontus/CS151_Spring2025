cos     log     sin
exp     log10   sqrt
fmod    pow     tan

ANSWER BELOW
*******************************************************************************
cos(x) - Computes the cosine of x, where x is in radians.

log(x) - Computes the natural logarithm (base e) of x.

sin(x) - Computes the sine of x, where x is in radians.

exp(x) - Computes e raised to the power of x (e^x).

log10(x) - Computes the common logarithm (base 10) of x.

sqrt(x) - Computes the square root of x.

fmod(x, y) - Computes the floating-point remainder of x / y (similar to modulo but for floating-point numbers).

pow(x, y) - Computes x raised to the power of y (x^y).

tan(x) - Computes the tangent of x, where x is in radians.
