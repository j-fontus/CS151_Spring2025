#include <iomanip>
}
cout << person << endl;
string person = "Wolfgang Smith";
int main()
cout << person << endl;
{
#include <iostream>
return 0;
cout << left;

When the lines are properly arranged, the program should display the following:

      Wolfgang Smith
Wolfgang Smith

Rearrange the lines in the correct order. Test the program by entering it on the
computer, compiling it, and running it.
