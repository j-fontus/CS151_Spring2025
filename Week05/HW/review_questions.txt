1. Assume that the following variables are defined:
    int length;
    double breadth;

    What will be the values in length and breadth, if the user enters 9.5 and 10.5 in
    response to the statement, cin >> length >> breadth?

    length = 9 ( since length is an int,it truncates the decimal part)

    breadth = 10.5 (since breadth is a double, it stores the full value)

2. Assume a string object has been defined as follows:

    string description;

    (A) Write a cin statement that reads in a one-word string.

         cin >> description,

    (B) Write a statement that reads in a string that can contain multiple words separated
        by blanks.

        getline(cin, description),

3. What header files must be included in the following program?


    #include <iostream>
    #include <iomanip>
    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        double amount = 89.7;
        cout << showpoint << fixed;
        cout << setw(8) << amount << endl;
        return 0;
    }

4. Complete the following table by determining the value of each expression.

    Expression                          Value
    28 / 4 − 2  = 5                      
    6 + 12 * 2 − 8  = 22                 
    4 + 8 * 2    = 20                       
    6 + 17 % 3 − 2  = 5                    
    2 + 22 * (9 − 7)  = 46                  
    (8 + 7) * 2   = 30                     
    (16 + 7) % 2 − 1 = 0                  
    12 / (10 − 6) = 3                      
    (19 − 3) * (2 + 2) / 4 = 16             

5. Write C++ expressions for the following algebraic expressions:

    a = 12x = a = 12 * x;
    z = 5x + 14y + 6k = z = 5 * x + 14 * y + 6 * k;
    y = x^4 = y + pow(x,4);
    g = h + 12 
        ------- = (h + 12) / (4 * k)
          4k

    c =  a^3
        ------- = pow(a,3) / pow(b,2) * pow(k * 4) 
        b^2k^4


6. Assume a program has the following variable definitions:
    int units;
    float mass;
    double weight;

    and the following statement:

    weight = mass * units;

    Which automatic data type conversion will take place?
    (A) mass is demoted to an int, units remains an int, and the result of mass * units
        is an int.
    (B) units is promoted to a float, mass remains a float, and the result of mass *
        units is a float.
    *(C) units is promoted to a float, mass remains a float, and the result of mass *
        units is a double.

7. Assume a program has the following variable definitions:

    int a, b = 2;
    float c = 4.2;

    and the following statement:

    a = b * c;

    What value will be stored in a?
    (A) 8.4
    (B) 8
    (C) 0
    (D) None of the above

    (B) 8

8. Assume qty and salesReps are both integers. Use a type cast expression to rewrite
    the following statement so it will no longer perform integer division.
    unitsEach = qty / salesReps;

    unitsEach = static_cast<double>(qty) / salesReps;

9. Rewrite the following variable definition so that the variable is a named constant.
    int rate;
   
     const int RATE = 5;

10. Complete the following table by providing statements with combined assignment
    operators for the right-hand column. The statements should be equivalent to the state-
    ments in the left-hand column.

    Statements with                     Statements with
    Assignment Operator                 Combined Assignment Operator
    x = x + 5;                          x + = 5;
    total = total + subtotal;           total + = subtotal;
    dist = dist / rep;                  dist /= rep;
    ppl = ppl * period;                 ppl * = period;
    inv = inv − shrinkage;              inv- shrinkage;
    num = num % 2;                      num % = 2;

11. Write a multiple assignment statement that can be used instead of the following group
    of assignment statements:
    
    east = 1; 
    west = 1;
    north = 1;
    south = 1;
    
    east = west = north =  south = 1;



12. Write a cout statement so the variable divSales is displayed in a field of 8 spaces, in
    fixed-point notation, with a precision of 2 decimal places. The decimal point should
    always be displayed.

    cout << fixed << setprecision(2) << setw(8) << divSales << endl;

13. Write a cout statement so the variable totalAge is displayed in a field of 12 spaces,
    in fixed-point notation, with a precision of 4 decimal places.

    cout << fixed << setprecision(4) << setw(12) << totalAge << endl;

14. A variable velocity has a value of 180.67245612456. Write a cout statement to
    display it in a field of six spaces left-justified. Write another cout statement to dis-
    play it in 18 spaces with a precision of 12 decimal spaces, in fixed notation, with
    trailing zeros.

    cout << left << setw(6) << velocity << endl;

    cout << fixed << setprecision(12) << setw(18) velocity << endl;
