1. How many operands does each of the following types of operators require?
    _____1__ Unary
    ______2_ Binary
    ______3_ Ternary

2. How may the double variables temp, weight, and age be defined in one statement?
     double temp, weight, age;

3. How can the values of three variables length, breadth, and height be displayed
using one statement, such that each variable is displayed in a new line?
     
     cout << length << endl << breadth << endl << height << endl;

4. Assume that x is an integer variable, y is a floating-point variable, and z is a character
variable. Write statements in C++ to perform the following operations:

    (A) Add 10 to x.  
        
        x += 10;

    (B) Square the value of y. 

         y = y * y; 

    (C) Divide x by 7 and store the result in y.

         y =  x / 7;

    (D) Store '&' in z.

         z = '&'; 

    (E) Display the values of y and z on the screen.

         cout << y << "" << z << endl;

    (F) Display the rightmost digit of x on the screen.

         cout << x % 10 << endl;

    (G) Display the number of bytes used by an integer variable.

         cout << sizeof(int) << endl;

7. Modify the following program so it prints two blank lines between each line of text.

    #include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Two mandolins like creatures in the" << endl << endl << endl;

    cout << "dark" << endl << endl << endl;

    cout << "Creating the agony of ecstasy." << endl << endl << endl;

    cout << "  George Barker" << endl;

    return 0;
}

8. What will the following programs print on the screen?

    (A) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        int main()
        {
            int freeze = 32, boil = 212;
            freeze = 0;
            boil = 100;
            cout << freeze << endl << boil << endl;
            return 0;
        }

                 0
                 100

    (B) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            int x = 0, y = 2;
            x = y * 4;
            cout << x << endl << y << endl;
            return 0;
        }

            8
            2

    (C) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            cout << "I am the incredible";
            cout << "computing\nmachine";
            cout << "\nand I will\namaze\n";
            cout << "you.";
            return 0;
        }
I am the incrediblecomputing
machine
and I will 
amaze 
you.



    (D) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;

        int main()
        {
            cout << "Be careful\n";
            cout << "This might/n be a trick ";
            cout << "question\n";
            return 0;
        }

            cout << "This might/n be a trick";



    (E) #include <iostream>
        using namespace std;
        
        int main()
        {
            int a, x = 23;
            a = x % 2;
            cout << x << endl << a << endl;
            return 0;
        }

          23
