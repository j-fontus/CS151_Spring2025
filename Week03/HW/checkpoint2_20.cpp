/*
Write a program that defines an integer variable named age and a float
variable named weight. Store your age and weight, as literals, in the variables.
The program should display these values on the screen in a manner similar to
the following:

My age is 26 and my weight is 180 pounds.


(Feel free to lie to the computer about your age and your weight—it’ll
never know!)
