How would you modify Program 5-13 so any negative value is a sentinel?

Program 5-13:
 1  // This program calculates the total number of points a
 2  // soccer team has earned over a series of games. The user
 3  // enters a series of point values, then âˆ’1 when finished.
 4  #include <iostream>
 5  using namespace std;
 6
 7  int main()
 8  {
 9      int game = 1, // Game counter
10      points, // To hold a number of points
11      total = 0; // Accumulator 
12
13      cout << "Enter the number of points your team has earned\n";
    cout << "so far in the season. Enter any negative number when finished.\n\n";

    cout << "Enter the points for game " << game << ": ";
    cin >> points;
17
18      while (points >= 0)
19      {
20          total += points;
21          game++;
22          cout << "Enter the points for game " << game << ": ";
23          cin >> points;
24      }
25      cout << "\nThe total points are " << total << endl;
26      return 0;
27  }

I would condition whlie condition from points != -1 to >= 0 and changed the message to match the new
sentinal rule
